🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Streamlit
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python and Streamlit. It recommends movies based on content-based filtering by calculating similarity between movies. The application provides an interactive web-based user interface where users can select a movie and receive personalized recommendations along with movie posters.

The system uses precomputed similarity scores and fetches movie posters dynamically using the TMDB (The Movie Database) API.
